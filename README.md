A simple cellular automata simulation, it has 3 simple elements that interact by simple rules based on their neighboring tiles.
To select one of them, press a numerical key, according to the following table:

| Key |Particle | Moves to | Switches with |
|--|--|--|--|
|1| Sand | down, down-left, down-right | water, gas |
|2| Water | down, down-left, down-right, left, right | gas |
|3| Gas | up, up-left, up-right, left, right | - |

To place the selected particle, hold **LMB** on the portion of the screen you wish to create particles.
At the moment there is no display for which particle type is selected.
